  <h3 class="careful">Rarely Trust What You Hear in the News</h3>

  <p class="paragraph-1">Many people these days don't trust what they hear, see, or read in the news. The reasons for that can be <b>staggering and many</b>. Perhaps I need to add more this paragraph to make the colums longer. Whether any of the readers fall into any of these categories or other ones doesn't matter. You may be a reader who trusts in the same news day-in and day-out. I'm not judging. Just completing an exercise.The reasons for people's distrust in media coverage could be determined by:

  <ul>
    <li>Bias</li>
    <li>It's allways the same</li>
    <li>They were there and that's not what happened</li>
  </ul>
